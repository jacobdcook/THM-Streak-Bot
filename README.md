# TryHackMe Streak Bot

An automated bot that maintains your TryHackMe streak using GitHub Actions. Set it up once and never worry about losing your streak again!

## 🔥 Features

- **Fully Automated**: Runs in GitHub Actions cloud - no local computer needed
- **Secure**: Your credentials are stored as encrypted GitHub secrets
- **Reliable**: Powered by GitHub's robust infrastructure
- **CAPTCHA Solver**: Automatically bypasses TryHackMe's reCAPTCHA
- **Detailed Logs**: Every action is logged and stored as GitHub artifacts
- **Customizable Schedule**: Set your preferred time for the daily check-in

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1. Fork this repository

Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account.

### 2. Configure your TryHackMe credentials

Navigate to your forked repository's Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions, and add the following repository secrets:

- `THM_EMAIL`: Your TryHackMe email address
- `THM_PASSWORD`: Your TryHackMe password

### 3. Adjust the schedule (optional)

By default, the bot runs daily at 12:30 UTC. You can modify this in the `.github/workflows/thmbot.yml` file:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '30 12 * * *'  # Format: minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week
```

### 4. Enable GitHub Actions

Go to the Actions tab in your repository and enable workflows if prompted.

## 📊 Monitoring

### Checking logs

After each run:
1. Go to the Actions tab in your repository
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. Download the "thm-bot-logs" artifact to view detailed logs

### Manual trigger

You can manually trigger the workflow at any time:
1. Go to the Actions tab
2. Select "TryHackMe Streak Bot" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"

## 📖 How It Works

The bot uses Selenium with Firefox in headless mode to:
1. Log in to your TryHackMe account
2. Solve any CAPTCHA challenges using audio recognition
3. Navigate to a specific room
4. Reset progress and complete an action to maintain your streak
5. Verify the streak counter has increased
6. Log all actions for review

## 📝 Troubleshooting

- **Failed Runs**: Check the workflow logs for specific error messages
- **CAPTCHA Issues**: If Google's reCAPTCHA patterns have changed, an update might be needed
- **IP Blocking**: If you notice unusual failures, TryHackMe might be rate-limiting the GitHub Actions IP ranges
